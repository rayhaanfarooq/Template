This is a SaaS template. As someone who loves building SaaS, I found it tiring and boring having to setup up everything froms scratch. From adding authentication, to installing the libraries, to setting up my landing page. It was super time consuming. The alternative templates all cost money. So I decided to build my own template so I can fork whenever I want to and actually focus on building my SaaS rather than the landing page.

Pre-Installed: ShadCNUI, TailwindCSS, Next.JS, React.JS, Firebase, Lucide React Icons, Stripe.

All you need to do is add your enviornment variables and you're good to go. Develop SaaS faster, and easier without the encumbering and time-consuming nuances.



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
